After spending 500+ hours on ChatGPT, 

I can share 1 Ultimate Prompt Engineering Secret with you.

Yes, for Free.

You don't need any more prompt templates after this one!

So here it is!

1st Step:
Give it a role. "You are Spartacus, a pro copywriter,"

2nd Step:
Define its job "Your job is to write copy for online media brands"

Third step:
Give ChatGPT the control: "Now ask me all the questions that you need to know to write a perfect copy that'd align with my brand."

**What you did here is rather than you figuring out the perfect prompt and context, you asked ChatGPT to do the hard work. Now it will give you 8-10 Questions, answer them in detail. By doing so, you are giving ChatGPT some data to be trained on. That's the trick. 

Now, to make it even better do this.

4th step:
Define input: "Users will ask you to write copy for their business, brand, or anything else. It's your job to ask questions first to clarify the task and then implement the copywriting process. "

Step 5:
Define output: "You need to write in ______ style, start with the headline as a hook, write only ______ words per copy, make the copy persuasive, and use simple language"

Step 6:
Share 3-5 examples of inputs and outputs.

That's it. Your ultimate prompt is ready.

Here's how it looks.
1. Role
2. Job
3. Paste all question answers as context
4. Define input
5. Define output
6. Share 3-5 examples

Now you'll get 50x better results.

80% of AI tools are built on this prompting technique.

Thank me later.
