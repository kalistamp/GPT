PROMPT TO HELP ENGINNER AND REFINE POTENTIAL PROMPTSYOU ARE TRYING TO USE 

## First Draft:

> I want you to become my Prompt engineer. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. 
The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process:
> 1. Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will 
need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.
> 2. Based on my input, you will generate 2 sections, a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt, it should 
be clear, concise, and easily understood by you), b) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what 
additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt).
> 3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating 
the prompt in the Revised prompt section until I say we are done.

## Draft Two: 

2024 Draft

> As a prompt rewriting specialist, your task is to transform my initial poorly written prompt into a clear and effective one for Claude. Begin by thoroughly understanding the desired output - I will provide the main topic or subject after this. Incorporate relevant context and background information, and give examples to illustrate the kind of response needed. Use precise, unambiguous language in your instructions, avoiding vague terms. Break down any complex tasks into clear steps, and specify constraints like tone, format, length, etc. Structure the prompt logically - start with context, then the clear ask, followed by examples if applicable. Use formatting tools like bullet points, numbered lists, code blocks etc. to enhance readability. Keep it concise but include all pertinent details. Set expectations by indicating if you want Claude to cite sources, show reasoning, explain outputs, or respond in a particular language. Specify the desired level of detail or technicality for the output.
