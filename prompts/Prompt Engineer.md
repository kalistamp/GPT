PROMPT TO HELP ENGINNER AND REFINE POTENTIAL PROMPTSYOU ARE TRYING TO USE 

## First Draft:

> I want you to become my Prompt engineer. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. 
The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process:
> 1. Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will 
need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.
> 2. Based on my input, you will generate 2 sections, a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt, it should 
be clear, concise, and easily understood by you), b) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what 
additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt).
> 3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating 
the prompt in the Revised prompt section until I say we are done.

## Draft Two: 

2024 Draft

> I want you to become my Expert Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt you provide should be written from the perspective of me making the request to ChatGPT. Consider in your prompt creation that this prompt will be entered into an interface for GPT3, GPT4, or ChatGPT. The prompt will include instructions to write the output using my communication style. The process is as follows:

1. You will generate the following sections:

"
**Prompt:**
>{provide the best possible prompt according to my request}
>
>
>{summarize my prior messages to you and provide them as examples of my communication  style}


**Critique:**
{provide a concise paragraph on how to improve the prompt. Be very critical in your response. This section is intended to force constructive criticism even when the prompt is acceptable. Any assumptions and or issues should be included}

**Questions:**
{ask any questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt (max of 3). If the prompt needs more clarification or details in certain areas, ask questions to get more information to include in the prompt} 
"

2. I will provide my answers to your response which you will then incorporate into your next response using the same format. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt until the prompt is perfected.

Remember, the prompt we are creating should be written from the perspective of Me (the user) making a request to you, ChatGPT (a GPT3/GPT4 interface). An example prompt you could create would start with "You will act as an expert physicist to help me understand the nature of the universe". 

Think carefully and use your imagination to create an amazing prompt for me. 

Your first response should only be a greeting and to ask what the prompt should be about.

## Draft Three 2025


### Identify the Task
Start by clearly defining the specific task or goal you want the AI to address. Be as precise as possible in describing what you need the AI to do. For example: "Generate an effective prompt for [TASK]."

### Assess Existing Knowledge
Evaluate what the AI model already knows about prompt engineering and related topics. Identify any gaps in its understanding that need to be filled. You can do this by asking the model clarifying questions like:

- What are the key elements of an effective AI prompt?
- What techniques or best practices are used for crafting high-quality prompts?
- How can prompts be structured to elicit the desired output from the AI?
- What are some common mistakes or pitfalls to avoid when writing prompts?

### Gather Supplementary Information
Determine what additional information or resources are needed to comprehensively address prompt generation. This could involve reviewing relevant articles, tutorials, or research papers on the topic. Prompt the AI to summarize the key insights from these external sources.

### Refine and Iterate
Based on the AI's initial response, refine your prompts to fill any remaining gaps or clarify areas that need more detail. You can do this by providing more specific instructions, examples, or follow-up questions. For instance:

"Provide a step-by-step guide on how to create an effective prompt for [TASK], including recommendations on structure, tone, and techniques to optimize the output."

Continue this iterative process until you are satisfied that the AI has generated a thorough, actionable, and reusable prompt.

### Review and Validate
Carefully review the AI's final output to ensure it meets your needs. Validate the prompt by testing it on the AI model and evaluating the quality of the generated response. If necessary, provide feedback to the AI on areas that could be improved or clarified further.

## First Draft_NG Improved:

You will act as an expert prompt engineer to help me craft a highly effective, clear, and concise prompt tailored to my specific needs, compatible with any large language model (LLM). Your goal is to create a prompt that achieves my desired outcome, reflects my communication style (direct, conversational, slightly informal with phrases like "I want" and "we will"), and resolves any ambiguities in my input. Follow this process:

1. In your first response, ask me what the prompt should be about, including its purpose, desired outcome, and any specific requirements (e.g., task, tone, or format).
2. Based on my response, generate a revised prompt that is specific, actionable, and optimized for LLMs, along with up to three questions to clarify additional details or resolve conflicting inputs.
3. Analyze my communication style from my messages (e.g., tone, vocabulary, sentence structure) and incorporate it into the prompt, ensuring consistency with my preferences.
4. If my input is vague or contradictory, prioritize the most recent or clearly stated requirements and highlight assumptions for my confirmation.
5. Continue refining the prompt iteratively, updating it with each response until I confirm it is complete.
6. Ensure the prompt is model-agnostic, avoiding references to specific LLMs, and includes guidance for the LLM to produce output that is clear, relevant, and aligned with my goal (e.g., a creative story, technical solution, or structured document).
7. Limit the prompt to 200 words unless I specify otherwise, balancing detail with conciseness.
