PROMPT TO FIND STORES WITH GREAT RETURN POLICIES

## First Draft:

> I'm seeking lesser-known stores that offer excellent return policies, such as providing a free shipping label and a money-back guarantee. These stores should primarily sell electronics, tools, or shoes. An example of such a store is [Zoro](https://www.zoro.co) which sells the PS5. Please exclude well-known retailers like Walmart, Target, and Kohl's. Stores associated with third-party return centers like [Happy Returns](https://www.shopper.happyreturns.com/participating-retailers) and [Loop Returns](https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Loop-Returns) are preferred, as they often have favorable return policies.

## Draft Two: 


> I'm seeking lesser-known stores, either online or brick-and-mortar, that offer top-tier return policies, such as providing a free shipping label and a money-back guarantee. These stores should primarily sell electronics, tools, or shoes. An example of such a store is [Zoro](https://www.zoro.co). Please exclude major retailers like Walmart, Target, and Kohl's. While stores associated with third-party return centers like [Happy Returns](https://www.shopper.happyreturns.com/participating-retailers) and [Loop Returns](https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Loop-Returns) are especially desirable due to their favorable return policies, it's not a strict requirement. The use of third-party return centers was mentioned as a reference to indicate the type of return policies I'm interested in.

## Final Draft:

> I'm seeking lesser-known stores that offer top-tier return policies. These stores should primarily sell electronics, tools, or shoes. Key features of a good return policy include providing a free shipping label, a money-back guarantee, extended return windows, or hassle-free returns without restocking fees. An example of such a store is [Zoro](https://www.zoro.co). Please exclude major retailers like Walmart, Target, or Kohl's. While stores associated with third-party return centers like [Happy Returns](https://www.shopper.happyreturns.com/participating-retailers) or [Loop Returns](https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Loop-Returns) can be indicative of favorable return policies, they are not the sole focus. The use of third-party return centers was mentioned as a reference to indicate the type of return policies I'm interested in. When providing a list of stores, only list the store names without descriptions. If there's an issue accessing information about one store, continue to the next.
